REEL BEETZ is the producer name of drummer Joel Studler. With great love for mellow drums and spicy basslines he crafts songs that are rooted in and evolve from Hip-Hop, Soul and Funk. He incorporates Jazz harmonies, Hip-Hop drums and Funk basslines into his raw and genuine production leading to a colorful palette of sound and texture. With his unique drumming style and the blend of live instruments with samples he creates an organic and original sound that just feels right. Live he is joined by talented musicians in performing a live set that combines the continuity and danceability of a DJ set and the dynamic range of a Jazz band. The beat goes on & on.
